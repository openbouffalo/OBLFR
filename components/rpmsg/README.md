## RPMsg - Remote Processor Messaging

A implmentation of the RPMsg protocol for bare-metal systems. 

This component allows firmware running on different cores to exchagne messages with each other. 
It is compatible with the Linux kernel implementation of RPMsg, and can be used to communicate with Linux applications/drivers.

It can also be used to communicate with bare metal firmware running on different cores.
