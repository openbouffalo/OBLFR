# OpenBouffalo Firmware Repository

This is a collection of Firmware/Example Applications for the Bouffalo Range of Chips utilizing the [Bouffalo MCU SDK](https://github.com/bouffalolab/bl_mcu_sdk/) 


## Quick Start
For Bouffallo based boards:
```
git clone https://github.com/openbouffalo/OBLFR.git
git clone https://github.com/bouffalolab/bl_mcu_sdk.git
git clone git@gitee.com:bouffalolab/toolchain_gcc_t-head_linux.git
PATH=$PATH:<directory to toolchain_gcc_t-head_linux>/bin/
cd OBLFR/apps/helloworld
make
```
Then use BLDevCube to Flash the build/build_out/helloworld_m0.elf to your device

if your bl_mcu_sdk is located in a different path, then the following will work:

```BL_SDK_BASE=<path> make```

## Configuring SDK Features

The Bouffalo SDK provides numerous configuration options, enabled via the proj.conf in a standard bl_mcu_sdk project. This repository has enabled menuconfig, to give a graphical interface to enable/disable features in the SDK. You can enter the configuration dialog by running in each applications directory: 
```
make config
``` 


Default Configuration Options for a application are saved in ```sdkconfig.default```, and when a project is built, a ```sdkconfig``` is created (and may be edited by hand, or updated with ```make config```). 
```build/config/sdkconfig.h``` header file is also created when compiling, and any configuration options that affect cmake are placed into ```proj.conf```

If a Application has a specific configuration options, a ```Kconfig``` file can be placed in the root of the application directory and it will be picked up automatically

*If you wish to help out, updating the [cmake/Kconfig](cmake/Kconfig)  with additional/new options or help text is greatly appreciated*

## Specifying Different CPU's or Cores

This SDK still respects the following commands to specify different CPU's/cores etc:
```
make BOARD=board_name
```
For the BL808, you can specify the following cores:
``` 
BOARD=ox64  CHIP_ID=m0 make
```

A list of boards can be found in [cmake/bflbsdk.cmake](cmake/bflbsdk.cmake) under the ```set(BOARD_LIST``` section

Please ensure you run ```make distclean``` if you change chips/boards or CPU's

## Specify Location of the Bouffalo Labs MCU SDK

If your bl_mcu_sdk located in different path, then the following will work:
```BL_SDK_BASE=<path> make```

## Board Support

We currently have the following boards supported:
* Pine64 OX64 (bl808)
* Sispeed M1SDock (bl808)
* Sispeed M0SDock (bl616)
* Sispeed M0Sense (bl702)

Other Boards are welcome, please submit a PR with your board support package!
